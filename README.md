<h1>Brainwave</h1>
Brainwave is a web-based application built using React, designed to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience. It utilizes modern front-end technologies like React Router, TailwindCSS, and React Just Parallax for smooth navigation, animations, and UI styling.

<h2>Features:</h2>
1) Single Page Application (SPA) using react-router-dom for seamless navigation. <br>

2) Smooth scrolling and UI interactions with scroll-lock.<br>

3) Parallax effects powered by react-just-parallax.<br>

4) Modern UI styling with tailwindcss.
