<h1>Brainwave</h1>
Brainwave is a web-based application built using React, designed to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience. It utilizes modern front-end technologies like React Router, TailwindCSS, and React Just Parallax for smooth navigation, animations, and UI styling.

<h2>Features:</h2>
1) Single Page Application (SPA) using react-router-dom for seamless navigation. <br>

2) Smooth scrolling and UI interactions with scroll-lock.<br>

3) Parallax effects powered by react-just-parallax.<br>

4) Modern UI styling with tailwindcss.

<h2>Technologies & Dependencies:</h2>

react	^19.0.0	=> Core library for building the user interface.<br>
react-dom	^19.0.0	=> Provides DOM-specific methods for React.<br>
react-just-parallax	^3.1.16	=> Enables smooth parallax effects for UI elements.<br>
react-router-dom	^7.1.5	=>Handles routing in React applications.<br>
scroll-lock	^2.1.5 =>	Prevents unwanted scrolling on specific elements.<br>

<h2>Folder Structure</h2>
/dist        - Compiled static files for production
/src         - Main source code
  /components - Reusable UI components
  /pages      - Page-level React components
  /styles     - TailwindCSS styles
  /assets     - Images, icons, and static files

<h2>How It Works:</h2>

Parallax scrolling, smooth animations, and custom styling enhance user interaction.
